Home Assistant custom component to start Spotify playback on an idle Chromecast or a Spotify Connect device. Meaning you can target automation for chromecast as well as connect devices.

This component is not meant to be a full Spotify chromecast media_player but only serves to start the playback. Controlling the chromecast device and the Spotify playback after the initial start is done in their respective components. Because starting playback using the API requires more powerful token the username and password used for browser login is used.

Used by [Spotify-Card-V2](https://github.com/mikevanes/spotify-card-v2)

## Installation

### HACS

This component is easiest installed using [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs).

1. First Make sure you have `spotcast` installed through HACS:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=fondberg&repository=spotcast&category=integration)

2. Then, setup an account:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=spotcast)

### Manual installation

1. Copy all files from custom_components/spotcast/ to custom_components/spotcast/ inside your config Home Assistant directory
2. Reboot your Home Assistant.
3. Click the following link to setup an account:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=spotcast)

## Configuration

### Minimum Home Assistant version

Spotcast is compatible with any version since 2024.11.0.

### Official Spotify Integration

> [!NOTE]
> Note that starting with `v5.0.0`, [Home Assistant Spotify Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/spotify/) is no longer a requirement **except for Media Browsing**. Click the following link to setup the spotify integration:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=spotify)

### Setup

> [!WARNING]
> It is highly recommended to set a separate Spotify App for Spotcast, especially for multiple accounts. Spotcast + Spotify Integration can lead to high API request if all combined in the same Authentication Application.

> [!WARNING]
> If you need to update your application credentials (changed in secret, new Spotify Application). Please follow [these instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/application_credentials/)

There are 2 steps for the setup of an account with spotcast

1. **Integration of the OAuth Client Information:** An OAuth client from Spotify must be provided to access your account profile and informations. You can follow the same step as described in the [Home Assistant Spotify Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/spotify/).
2. **Integration of the private API credentials:** Spotcast relies on the private Spotify API to link a chromecast device to your spotify account when you are trying to start playback (mimmicking what the Spotify Desktop or Spotify Mobile app are doing). The only known way of connecting to that API is through the use of browser cookies. These can be retrieved by:
    - connecting to [spotify.com](open.spotify.com)
    - opening the developper console
    - pasting the `sp_dc` and `sp_key` in the Home Assistant setup form

> [!TIP]
> See [Obtaining SP_DC and SP_KEY](./docs/config/obtaining_sp_dc_and_sp_key.md) for more details

## Services

The spotcast custom component provides multiple services to the user for different use cases. The services available are as followed (link to full documentation in table):
