# Spotcast
Home Assistant custom component to start Spotify playback on an idle chromecast device

This component is not meant to be a full Spotify chromecast media_player but only serves to start the playback. Controlling the chromcast device and the Spotify playback after the initial start is done in their respective components.
Becasue starting playback using the API requires more powerful token the username and password used for browser login is used.

Used by https://github.com/custom-cards/spotify-card.

Community post: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/spotcast-custom-component-to-start-playback-on-an-idle-chromecast-device/114232

_Now with support for speaker groups, transferring playback to and between chromecast devices and using HA entity id instead of device_name_.

***Important***
Release 2.6.1 has a woraround for zeroconf 0.24.4 so it is no longer needed to use older version.
