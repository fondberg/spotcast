# Spotcast
Home Assistant custom component to start Spotify playback on an idle chromecast device. As of version 2.8.0 it also supports playback on Spotify Connect devices (thanks to @kleinc80) which means that you can target your automation for chromecast as well as connect devices.

This component is not meant to be a full Spotify chromecast media_player but only serves to start the playback. Controlling the chromcast device and the Spotify playback after the initial start is done in their respective components.
Becasue starting playback using the API requires more powerful token the username and password used for browser login is used.

Used by https://github.com/custom-cards/spotify-card.

***Important***

Release 2.7.0 requires home-assistant >= 0.105.0

Release 2.8.0 now supports Spotify connect devices (thanks to @kleinc80). And no, Sonos would still require extra integration, send one to me and I'll integrate it.

Release 2.9.0 transfer_playback removed! Now supports possibility to "Transfer Playback" even when there is nothing currently playing

***Required configuration change with release 2.9.0***

The parameter transfer_playback does not exist anymore and if you use it, you need to update your configuration. Use an empty uri and optionally the new parameter force_playback instead.

## Installation

### This component is easiest installed using [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

### Manual
Copy all files from custom_components/spotcast/ to custom_components/spotcast/ inside your config Home Assistant directory.

Add the following to your config
```
spotcast:
  username: !secret spotify_username
  password: !secret spotify_password
```
#### Multiple accounts
Add `accounts` dict to the configuration and populate with a list of accounts to
be able to initiate playback using diffferent accounts than the default.
```
