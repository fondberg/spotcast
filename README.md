# Spotcast 
Home Assistant custom component to start Spotify playback on an idle chromecast device

This component is not meant to be a full Spotify chromecast media_player but only serves to start the playback. Controlling the chromcast device and the Spotify playback after the initial start is done in their respective components.
Becasue starting playback using the API requires more powerful token the username and password used for browser login is used.

Used by https://github.com/custom-cards/spotify-card.

 ## Known issues
 It has been reported that updating the sensor takes more than 10s sometimes. 
 This sensor uses `pychromecast` directly and if you don't need the sensor you can safely comment out the registration 
 of the sensor. 
 ```
     # hass.services.register(DOMAIN, 'start', start_casting,
     #                       schema=SERVICE_START_COMMAND_SCHEMA)
 ```
